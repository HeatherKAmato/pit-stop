DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

1. Data: Data on Pit Stop restrooms were obtained from the SF Department of Public Works. Data on 311 calls (i.e. feces reports) are publicly available here: https://datasf.org/opendata/
	
	A. weekly_calls.csv - this is a processed dataset ready for analysis, including the number of 311 calls (i.e. feces reports) within a 500 meter walking distance of each 
  	Pit Stop intervention in each week during a six month pre-intervention period and a six month post-intervention period. This dataset was produced in the RMD file
  	'SF_PitStop_PrepData.Rmd', and is used to conduct the final analysis in 'SF_PitStop_ITSAnalysis.Rmd'.
	
	B. all311calls_filtered.csv - this is a processed dataset containing all 311 calls containing reports of exposed feces. This dataset is necessary for prepping the 
	weekly_calls.csv dataset using code in 'SF_PitStop_PrepData.Rmd'.

	C. buffer_0_1km.shp, buffer_0_322km.shp, & buffer_0_5km.shp - these are shapefiles from walking distance buffer polygons around each Pit Stop intervention location. 
	These files are necessary for creating the weekly_calls.csv in 'SF_PitStop_PrepData.Rmd'.

	D. Pit_Stops_Dates.csv - raw data file with information on Pit Stop restroom interventions.

2. Code:
	A. SF_PitStop_PrepData.Rmd - R code used to process data and conduct spatial/temporal join of Pit Stop interventions and 311 calls. This code uses datasets in B, C, 
	and D listed above, and produces dataset A.

	B. SF_PitStop_ITSAnalysis.Rmd - R code used to conduct interrupted time series analysis and permutation tests using the weekly_calls.csv dataset.


METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: Data on Pit Stop locations and intervention start dates were provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Works (DPW) upon request. We downloaded San Francisco 311 reports from a public website: https://datasf.org/opendata/. 

2. The following methods were used for processing the raw/collected data used for this submitted dataset: Only included Pit Stop interventions implemented between Jan. 1 2014 and Jan. 1 2020. Only included 311 reports of type 'Human/Animal Waste', excluded reports with “dup” or “transfer” in the status notes, and only included reports from agencies that respond to feces reports. In ArcGIS Online, we created 500-meter walking distance buffers (polygon derived from all 500m routes following pedestrian paths and roads) around each Pit Stop location to capture the number of 311 feces reports within the surrounding area of each intervention. Feces reports were then spatially and temporally matched to each Pit Stop intervention in RStudio.

3. Software-specific information needed to interpret the data: All analyses were conducted using R Studio version 1.3 using the following packages: 
   sf, lubridate, data.table, ggspatial, mapview, ggpubr, ggplot2, Rmisc, perm, MASS, sandwich, lmtest, car, and tidyverse
